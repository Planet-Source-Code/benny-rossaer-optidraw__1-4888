### Description

'OptiDraw' is actually a pretty descent drawing program. It's not as good as Microsoft's Paint, but I like to think it comes pretty close. You can load, save and print images, draw free-hand, draw lines, circles, rectacles, filled rectacles, and more. There are also some tools and filters. I integrated Sneechy's 'Instant Art' program and some other stuff from Planet Source Code, if I used your code, e-mail me at benny.rossaer@vt4.net and I will give you credit.
